# RunRealm - ZetaChain Fitness GameFi Platform

Transform your runs into valuable NFT territories on ZetaChain, with Google Gemini AI coaching and immersive GameFi mechanics.

## üéØ **CURRENT STATUS: LIVE ON ZETACHAIN TESTNET**

RunRealm is deployed and functional for single-chain territory gaming on ZetaChain Athens Testnet. Users can create territory NFTs, earn REALM rewards, and track running progress.

## üèÜ **GOOGLE BUILDATHON SUBMISSION - CROSS-CHAIN INNOVATION**

This project demonstrates advanced cross-chain functionality using ZetaChain's Universal Contract capabilities, specifically addressing the "Cross-Chain Lending" and "Web3 Applications" tracks.

### üåü Key Cross-Chain Features

1. **True Cross-Chain Territory Ownership**
   - Claim territories from any supported blockchain (Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, etc.)
   - Territories minted on ZetaChain with cross-chain provenance
   - Gas paid only on user's native chain

2. **Universal Contract Integration**
   - Single interface for all blockchain interactions
   - Cross-chain messaging via ZetaChain's Gateway API
   - Seamless experience regardless of user's chain

3. **Gas Abstraction**
   - Users never need to acquire ZETA tokens
   - All gas costs paid on origin chain
   - Eliminates friction for cross-chain interactions

4. **Cross-Chain Activity Tracking**
   - Visual chain indicators on territories
   - Cross-chain history for each territory
   - Unified dashboard showing multi-chain activity

### üöÄ Technical Implementation

**Smart Contracts:**
- ZetaChain Universal Contract handles all cross-chain operations
- `onCall` function processes incoming cross-chain messages
- Territory NFTs with cross-chain metadata

**Frontend:**
- Cross-chain service orchestrates ZetaChain interactions
- Territory service tracks cross-chain ownership
- UI components show chain-specific information

**API Usage:**
```typescript
// Cross-chain territory claim
const tx = await zetaClient.gateway.sendMessage({
  signer: walletSigner,
  destinationChainId: 7001,
  destinationAddress: contractAddress,
  message: encodedData,
  gasLimit: 500000
});
```

## Development Setup

### Environment Variables

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Fill in your actual API keys in the `.env` file:
   - Mapbox Access Token (get from https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/)
   - Google Gemini API Key (get from https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)

### Development API Keys

For development, the application uses multiple fallback methods to load API keys:

1. Runtime tokens endpoint (Express.js server)
2. localStorage (set automatically in development mode)
3. src/appsettings.secrets.ts (not committed to version control)

To set up your development environment with API keys:

1. Create `src/appsettings.secrets.ts` from the example:
   ```bash
   cp src/appsettings.secrets.example.ts src/appsettings.secrets.ts
   ```

2. Fill in your actual keys in `src/appsettings.secrets.ts`

**‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY WARNING**: Never commit `src/appsettings.secrets.ts` to version control. The file is already included in `.gitignore`.

### Running the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The development server will automatically set the API keys in localStorage for development use.

## Production Deployment

For production deployment, API keys should NEVER be included in client-side code. Instead:

1. Use secure server-side endpoints to provide tokens at runtime
2. Store actual API keys as environment variables on your server
3. Use the Express.js server (already set up) to serve tokens securely

### Express.js Server (Default and Recommended)

The application includes an Express.js server that serves static files and provides the API endpoint for tokens.

1. Set your API keys as environment variables:
   ```bash
   export MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_mapbox_token
   export GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key
   ```

2. Build the application:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```

The server will serve the static files and provide the API endpoint for tokens at `/api/tokens`.

### Deployment to Your Hetzner Server

Since you have a Hetzner server, you can deploy the application there:

1. Clone the repository to your Hetzner server:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd RunRealm
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set your API keys as environment variables in a `.env` file or systemd service:
   ```bash
   echo "MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_mapbox_token" >> .env
   echo "GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key" >> .env
   ```

4. Build the application:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```

For production use, you should set up a systemd service to run the server automatically and use a reverse proxy like Nginx for SSL termination.

### Other Serverless Platforms

If you prefer to use serverless platforms, you can also deploy the token endpoint to:
- AWS Lambda
- Google Cloud Functions
- Azure Functions
- Vercel Functions

Just make sure to update the `fetchRuntimeTokens` method in `src/core/app-config.ts` to point to your endpoint.
