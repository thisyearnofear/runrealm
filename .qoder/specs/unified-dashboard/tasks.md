# Unified Dashboard - Implementation Tasks

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation tasks for creating a unified dashboard that consolidates all user information into one easily accessible location. The implementation will follow existing project patterns and integrate with current services.

## Implementation Tasks

- [ ] 1. **Setup and Configuration**
  - Create UnifiedDashboard class extending BaseService
  - Set up dependency injection for required services
  - Initialize event listeners and subscriptions
  - Create basic container element structure

- [ ] 2. **Core Dashboard Structure**
  - Implement dashboard HTML structure with all sections
  - Add CSS styling for desktop and mobile views
  - Create responsive layout with media queries
  - Implement toggle functionality using existing patterns

- [ ] 3. **Data Integration**
  - Integrate with RunTrackingService for run data
  - Connect to ProgressionService for gamification data
  - Link with Web3Service for wallet information
  - Incorporate TerritoryService for territory data
  - Set up AIService for AI insights

- [ ] 4. **State Management**
  - Integrate with WidgetStateService for persistence
  - Connect to VisibilityService for visibility control
  - Implement user preference storage
  - Add state synchronization across services

- [ ] 5. **UI Components**
  - Create user stats display component
  - Implement current run visualization
  - Build recent activity section
  - Develop territory information panel
  - Add AI insights display
  - Create wallet status component

- [ ] 6. **Mobile Adaptations**
  - Integrate with MobileWidgetService
  - Implement touch-optimized controls
  - Add compact view for small screens
  - Ensure orientation handling

- [ ] 7. **Toggle Functionality**
  - Implement show/hide methods using CSS classes
  - Add persistence through WidgetStateService
  - Integrate with VisibilityService
  - Create toggle button in main UI

- [ ] 8. **Error Handling**
  - Implement graceful degradation for missing services
  - Add error messages for failed data retrieval
  - Create retry mechanisms for transient failures
  - Add fallback to cached data

- [ ] 9. **Performance Optimization**
  - Implement lazy loading for dashboard content
  - Add debouncing for frequent updates
  - Optimize DOM updates with CSS classes
  - Ensure efficient data loading

- [ ] 10. **Testing**
  - Write unit tests for data processing functions
  - Create integration tests with mock services
  - Implement UI interaction tests
  - Add mobile responsiveness tests

- [ ] 11. **Documentation and Cleanup**
  - Update documentation with new component
  - Add code comments for maintainability
  - Perform code cleanup and optimization
  - Ensure consistency with existing codebase

## Files to Create/Modify
- `/src/components/unified-dashboard.js` - Main dashboard component implementation
- `/src/components/unified-dashboard.css` - Dashboard styling
- `/src/core/app-config.js` - Register dashboard service (if needed)
