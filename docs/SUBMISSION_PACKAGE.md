# RunRealm - Google Buildathon Submission Package

## Project Overview

**RunRealm** is a cross-chain fitness GameFi platform that transforms traditional running into valuable NFT territories using ZetaChain's Universal Contracts and Google Gemini AI coaching.

### Core Innovation

RunRealm pioneers the first truly cross-chain fitness GameFi experience by leveraging ZetaChain's Universal Contract capabilities to allow users from any supported blockchain to claim and own territories as NFTs on ZetaChain, paying gas only on their native chain.

## Technical Implementation

### ZetaChain Integration

1. **Universal Contract**: Deployed on ZetaChain Athens Testnet
   - Address: `0x7A52d845Dc37aC5213a546a59A43148308A88983`
   - Handles all cross-chain territory operations
   - Implements `onCall` function for message processing

2. **Cross-Chain Messaging**: Utilizes ZetaChain's Gateway API
   - Users claim territories from Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, etc.
   - Messages routed through ZetaChain's infrastructure
   - Territories minted on ZetaChain with cross-chain provenance

3. **Gas Abstraction**: Revolutionary user experience
   - Users pay gas only on their native chain
   - No need to acquire ZETA tokens
   - Eliminates friction for cross-chain interactions

### Smart Contract Architecture

```solidity
contract RunRealmUniversal is UniversalContract {
    function onCall(
        MessageContext calldata context,
        address zrc20,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes calldata message
    ) external override {
        // Process cross-chain territory claims
        // Handle player stats updates
        // Manage reward distribution
    }
}
```

### Frontend Implementation

```typescript
// Cross-chain territory claiming
const crossChainService = new CrossChainService();
await crossChainService.sendCrossChainTerritoryClaim({
  originChainId: wallet.chainId,
  destinationChainId: 7001, // ZetaChain
  destinationAddress: contractAddress,
  territoryData: territoryData
});
```
