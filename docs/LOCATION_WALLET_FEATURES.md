# Location & Wallet Features Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of two critical features for RunRealm:

1. **Location Services** - User location detection and management
2. **Wallet Connection** - Web3 wallet integration for blockchain features

## 1. Location Services

### Features Implemented

#### 📍 Location Button
- Added to the game controls area
- Allows users to set their location manually or via GPS
- Styled with green gradient to match the app theme

#### 🗺️ Location Modal
- **GPS Location**: One-click GPS location detection
- **Address Search**: Search for cities, addresses, or landmarks using Mapbox Geocoding
- **Manual Input**: Users can select from search results
- **Current Location Display**: Shows current location with source (GPS/manual/default)

#### 🔄 Location Management
- Automatic location persistence using PreferenceService
- Location change events for map updates
- Support for location tracking (continuous GPS updates)
- Fallback to default location (currently NYC) if GPS fails

### Technical Implementation

```typescript
// Location Service Usage
const locationService = new LocationService(geocodingService, preferenceService, domService);

// Get current GPS location
const location = await locationService.getCurrentLocation();

// Search for locations
const results = await locationService.searchLocations("San Francisco");

// Set manual location
locationService.setManualLocation(37.7749, -122.4194, "San Francisco, CA");
```

### UI Components
- **Location Button**: `📍 Set Location` in controls area
- **Location Modal**: Full-featured location selection interface
- **Search Results**: Real-time search with Mapbox Geocoding API
- **GPS Integration**: Native browser geolocation API

## 2. Wallet Connection

### Features Implemented

#### 🦊 Wallet Connection Button
- Shows connection status (connected/disconnected)
- Displays wallet address when connected
- Animated connection indicator
- Click to connect or view wallet info

#### 🚀 Wallet Modal (ConnectKit-style)
- **Multiple Wallet Support**:
  - MetaMask (with installation detection)
  - WalletConnect (placeholder for mobile wallets)
  - Coinbase Wallet (with installation detection)
- **Installation Prompts**: Guides users to install missing wallets
- **Security Notice**: Reassures users about private key security
- **Benefits Display**: Shows what users gain by connecting

#### 💼 Wallet Management
- **Connection State**: Persistent wallet connection across sessions
- **Account Switching**: Automatic detection of account changes
- **Network Switching**: Support for multiple blockchain networks
- **Balance Display**: Shows ETH balance and wallet details

### Technical Implementation

```typescript
// Wallet Connection Usage
const walletConnection = new WalletConnection(domService, web3Service);

// Connect to specific wallet
await walletConnection.connectWallet('metamask');

// Show wallet selection modal
walletConnection.showWalletModal();

// Disconnect wallet
await walletConnection.disconnectWallet();
```

### Supported Networks
- **ZetaChain Testnet** (Primary - for $REALM tokens and NFTs)
- **Ethereum Mainnet** (Secondary)
- **Polygon** (Secondary)

## 3. Integration with RunRealm

### Location Integration
- **Map Initialization**: Uses user's location as default map center
- **Territory Claims**: Location affects which territories can be claimed
- **Route Planning**: AI route suggestions based on current location
- **Geofencing**: Future feature for location-based rewards

### Wallet Integration
- **Territory NFTs**: Claim and manage territory NFTs on-chain
- **$REALM Tokens**: Earn and spend in-game currency
- **Cross-Chain**: Support for multi-chain territory management
- **Session Persistence**: Maintains wallet connection across app restarts

### Event System
Both services integrate with the EventBus for loose coupling:

```typescript
// Location events
eventBus.on('location:changed', (locationInfo) => {
  // Update map center, nearby territories, etc.
});

// Wallet events
eventBus.on('web3:walletConnected', (walletInfo) => {
  // Enable GameFi features, load user NFTs, etc.
});
```

## 4. User Experience Flow

### First-Time User
1. **App loads** with default location (NYC)
2. **Location prompt** appears or user clicks location button
3. **GPS permission** requested or manual location search
4. **Map centers** on user's location
5. **Wallet connection** prompted for GameFi features
6. **Territory claiming** becomes available

### Returning User
1. **App loads** with saved location
2. **Wallet auto-connects** if previously connected
3. **GameFi features** immediately available
4. **Location can be updated** anytime via location button

## 5. Security & Privacy

### Location Privacy
- **No server storage**: Location data stays in browser localStorage
- **User control**: Users can always change or disable location
- **GPS optional**: Manual location input always available
- **Accuracy control**: Users can choose high/low accuracy GPS

### Wallet Security
- **No private key storage**: RunRealm never stores private keys
- **Read-only by default**: Only requests permissions when needed
- **User consent**: All transactions require explicit user approval
- **Network validation**: Ensures users are on correct networks

## 6. Future Enhancements

### Location Features
- **Offline maps**: Cache map tiles for offline use
- **Location history**: Track user's running locations
- **Geofenced rewards**: Special rewards for specific locations
- **Weather integration**: Show weather for user's location

### Wallet Features
- **WalletConnect v2**: Full mobile wallet support
- **Hardware wallets**: Ledger/Trezor support
- **Multi-wallet**: Connect multiple wallets simultaneously
- **Gas optimization**: Batch transactions and gas estimation

## 7. API Reference

## 8. Styling

All UI components use the custom CSS in `src/styles/location-wallet.css`:
- **Consistent theming** with RunRealm's green/orange color scheme
- **Mobile responsive** design
- **Smooth animations** and hover effects
- **Accessibility** considerations (focus states, ARIA labels)

The implementation provides a solid foundation for location-aware, blockchain-enabled gaming features while maintaining excellent user experience and security standards.
