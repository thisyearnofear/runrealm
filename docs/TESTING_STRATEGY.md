# RunRealm Comprehensive Testing Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the RunRealm monorepo architecture, ensuring quality and reliability across all packages and platforms.

## Testing Pyramid

### 1. Unit Testing (70%)
**Focus**: Individual functions, classes, and modules
**Packages**: All shared packages (@runrealm/shared-core, @runrealm/shared-types, @runrealm/shared-utils, @runrealm/shared-blockchain)
**Tools**: Jest, TypeScript
**Coverage Goal**: 80%+

#### Unit Test Structure
```

│   ├── services/
│   │   ├── __tests__/
│   │   │   ├── territory-service.test.ts
│   │   │   ├── run-tracking-service.test.ts
│   │   │   └── web3-service.test.ts
│   │   └── *.ts
│   └── core/
│       ├── __tests__/
│       │   ├── app-config.test.ts
│       │   └── event-bus.test.ts
│       └── *.ts
├── shared-utils/
│   ├── __tests__/

- **Edge Cases**: Boundary values, invalid inputs, malformed data
- **Performance Testing Data**: Large datasets for stress testing

### Test Environment Configuration
- **Development**: Local testing with mocked services
- **CI**: Automated testing with isolated environments
- **Staging**: Near-production testing with real services

## Monitoring and Reporting

### Test Coverage Metrics
- **Line Coverage**: Percentage of code lines executed
- **Branch Coverage**: Decision points covered
- **Function Coverage**: Functions tested
- **Statement Coverage**: Statements executed

### Quality Gates
- **Minimum Coverage**: 80% for unit tests
- **Pass Rate**: 100% for critical tests on main branch
- **Performance Thresholds**: Response times under acceptable limits
- **Security Checks**: Zero critical vulnerabilities
